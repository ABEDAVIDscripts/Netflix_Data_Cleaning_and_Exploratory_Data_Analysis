### Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and exploring the Netflix dataset to ensure data accuracy and uncover insights. It involves data preparation followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer key business questions about Netflix’s content library and distribution.

<br>

### Dataset
The dataset includes information about various content on Netflix, including movies, TV shows, and documentaries, with attributes like title, director, casts, country, date added, duration, and more.

#### About the Dataset:
- **Source:** [netflix_title.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)
- **Total Rows:** 8807+
- **Columns:** show_id, type, title, director, casts, country, date_added, release_year, rating, duration, listed_in, description

<br>

### Objectives

This project has two main objectives:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Address duplicate values, correct inconsistent formatting, and standardize the dataset for further analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform an in-depth analysis to answer 16 business-related questions based on the Netflix content data.
3. **Key Insights:**  Crucial findings derived from examining the datasets.

<br>

### Tools
The tools used for this project:
- MySQL Workbench:  main tool used in data cleaning and exploratory
- Excel:  CSV file containing Netflix_titles

<br>
<br>

## Data Cleaning
Steps taken in Netflix Data Cleaning:

#### 1. Create Database, Create a Table and Import the Dataset

*Create Database*

```sql
CREATE DATABASE project;
USE projects;
```

*Create a Table*

```sql
CREATE TABLE netflix
	(show_id varchar(10), 
	type varchar(15), 
	title varchar(150),
	director text,
	casts text,
	country varchar(150),
	date_added varchar(50),
	release_year INT,
	rating varchar(10),
	duration varchar(20),
	listed_in varchar(100),
	description text );
```

*Import data with local infile.*

```sql
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/netflix_titles.csv'
INTO TABLE netflix
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;
```

*verify the table*

```sql
SELECT * FROM netflix;
DESCRIBE netflix;
```

*Create a new work-table to protect the raw dataset.*

```sql
CREATE TABLE netflix_exp
LIKE netflix;
```

*Copy dataset into the new work table*

```sql
INSERT INTO netflix_exp
SELECT * FROM netflix;
```

*verify the New Work Table*

```sql
SELECT * FROM netflix_exp;
```

<br>

#### 2. Remove Duplicates

*check for duplicates using CTE*

```sql
WITH netflix_duplicate
AS
	(SELECT *, 
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY type, title, director, country, release_year, duration, listed_in) As Count
	FROM netflix_exp)
SELECT * FROM netflix_duplicate
WHERE count > 1;
```

*verify the duplicates*

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix_exp
WHERE 
title IN 
('Love in a Puff', 'Esperando la carroza', 'Sin senos sí hay paraíso')
ORDER BY title;
```

*delete the duplicates*

```sql
WITH netflix_duplicate
AS
	(SELECT *, 
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY type, title, director, country, release_year, duration, listed_in) As Count
	FROM netflix_exp)
DELETE FROM netflix_exp
WHERE show_id IN
	(SELECT show_id FROM netflix_duplicate WHERE count >1);
```

<br>

#### 3. General Standardization

- (A). Whitespace standardization: check for Leading or Trailing Spaces in the columns

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix_exp
WHERE 
	title != TRIM(title) OR
	director != TRIM(director) OR
	casts != TRIM(casts) OR
  	country != TRIM(country) OR
	date_added != TRIM(date_added) OR
	rating != TRIM(rating) OR
  	duration != TRIM(duration) OR
	listed_in != TRIM(listed_in) OR
	description != TRIM(description);
```

*whitespaces found! update to remove the whitespaces*

```sql
UPDATE netflix_exp
SET
    show_id = TRIM(show_id), 
    type = TRIM(type), 
    title = TRIM(title), 
    director = TRIM(director), 
    casts = TRIM(casts), 
    country = TRIM(country), 
    date_added = TRIM(date_added), 
    release_year = TRIM(release_year), 
    rating = TRIM(rating),
    duration = TRIM(duration), 
    listed_in = TRIM(listed_in), 
    description = TRIM(description);
```


- (B). Standardization by categorical values : check through the columns.
  
*check with TITLE column*

```sql
SELECT
	show_id, title 
FROM netflix_exp
WHERE
	title LIKE '%#%' OR title LIKE '%*%';
```
    
*update TITLE column to remove the '#'*

```sql
UPDATE
	netflix_exp
SET 
	title = REPLACE(title, '#', '');
```

*check with COUNTRY column*

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM netflix_exp;
```

*update the COUNTRY column to remove the error in (, France, Algeria) and (, South Korea)*

```sql
UPDATE netflix_exp
SET 
	country = REPLACE(country, ', ', '')
	WHERE country LIKE ',%';
```

<br>

#### 4. Date Standardization

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT date_added FROM netflix_exp;
```

*covert to standard DATE format*

```sql
UPDATE netflix_exp 
SET 
	date_added = STR_TO_DATE(date_added, '%M %d, %Y')
	WHERE date_added IS NOT NULL 
	AND date_added != '';
```

<br>

#### 5. Datatype Standardization

```sql
DESCRIBE netflix_exp;
```

*convert to DATE datatype: there are empty strings in date_added column, hence I change the empty string to a Null value*

```sql
UPDATE netflix_exp
SET 
	date_added = NULL 
	WHERE date_added = '';
```

*convert*

```sql
ALTER TABLE netflix_exp
MODIFY date_added date;
```

<br>

#### 6. Verification and Dataset Preparation for EDA

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM netflix_exp;

DESCRIBE netflix_exp;
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
